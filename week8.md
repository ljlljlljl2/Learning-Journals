# Learning Journal -- Week 8: Learning Experiment

## Learning Activities --- Learning Experiment

### 1. Hypothesis

I believe that: \> **Using the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused
work + 5 minutes of rest) will improve my concentration and learning
efficiency compared to studying continuously for a long period.**

Reasoning: In previous weeks, I noticed that I often became distracted
or mentally tired when studying for long periods without breaks. I
suspect that structured short breaks will help maintain focus and
productivity.

### 2. Experiment Design

To test this hypothesis, I designed a simple, repeatable two-day
experiment:

#### Day 1 --- Control Group: Continuous 90-minute Study Session

-   **Task:** A programming exercise + a short reading task\
-   **Method:** Study continuously for 90 minutes without taking breaks\
-   **Metrics recorded:**
    -   Task completion percentage\
    -   Number of distractions\
    -   Subjective fatigue level (1--10)

#### Day 2 --- Experimental Group: Pomodoro Technique (3 cycles = 75 minutes)

-   **Pomodoro setup:**
    -   25 minutes focused work\
    -   5 minutes break\
    -   Total time: 3 cycles (75 minutes)\
-   **Task:** A different set of programming and reading tasks with
    similar difficulty\
-   **Metrics recorded:**
    -   Task completion percentage\
    -   Number of distractions\
    -   Fatigue level (1--10)

### 3. Results

  Metric                   Continuous Study (90 min)   Pomodoro (3 × 25 min)
  ------------------------ --------------------------- -----------------------
  Task completion          65%                         **85%**
  Number of distractions   6                           **2**
  Fatigue level (1--10)    8                           **4**

#### Observations

-   The Pomodoro Technique resulted in **fewer distractions**.\
-   **More tasks were completed** despite the total work time being
    slightly shorter.\
-   I felt **significantly less tired** after the Pomodoro session.\
-   Overall, the Pomodoro method produced better performance and lower
    cognitive load.

### 4. Learning Insights

#### (1) Short, structured breaks improve productivity

I realized that forcing myself to work nonstop for long periods is
counterproductive. Short breaks help reset my focus and prevent mental
fatigue.

#### (2) My optimal concentration window is around 20--30 minutes

This experiment helped me understand that my natural attention span
aligns with the Pomodoro timing.

#### (3) Timers reduce procrastination

Having a visible countdown made it easier to start tasks, maintain
focus, and avoid distractions like checking my phone.

#### (4) Application for future study

I plan to continue using the Pomodoro Technique for: - Coding sessions\
- Reading technical documentation\
- Weekly study activities\
- Future assessments and assignments

### Conclusion

The experiment confirms my hypothesis:\
\> **The Pomodoro Technique significantly improves my concentration,
productivity, and overall learning efficiency compared to continuous
long study sessions.**

I will incorporate this method into my regular study routine moving
forward.
