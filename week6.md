Goals for this Week:
Familiarize with the project tools: Understand how to use Slack, GitHub, and Trello (or GitHub Projects) to organize tasks and communicate effectively within the team.
Set up the project repository on GitHub: Ensure the team has a functioning GitHub repo where all project-related code and documents are stored.
Work on initial project planning: Collaborate with teammates to start planning the project and set up initial tasks for each team member.
What I Learned:
GitHub:
This week, I learned how to set up a repository for the project. I followed the GitHub Classroom link to create the repo. After that, I made my first commit by adding a README.md file. I also learned how to push changes from my local machine to the GitHub repository.
I also explored how to manage branches and issues within the repo, which will help us track progress on specific tasks.
Slack:
I joined our team’s Slack channel and learned how to integrate GitHub and Trello with Slack. This integration allows us to get real-time updates on commits and task progress within our Slack workspace.
I also got familiar with Slack's file-sharing features, which will be useful for sharing resources and documents.
Trello:
I started using Trello to manage tasks and to collaborate on setting up our group agreement. I learned how to create cards for specific tasks and assign team members to them. This is useful for tracking who is responsible for what.
Our team created a Group Agreement on Trello, outlining expectations and team roles. I contributed by outlining my technical skills (e.g., Python, web development) and soft skills (e.g., communication, teamwork).
Challenges Encountered:
Learning GitHub workflows: At first, I found GitHub’s branching and merging system a little confusing, especially when working with team members on different branches. However, after reading a few tutorials and collaborating with my teammates, I gained more confidence in using GitHub effectively.
Setting up integrations in Slack: There were a few technical difficulties when setting up the GitHub and Trello integrations with Slack. I had to troubleshoot the process, but eventually, I figured out how to link the tools successfully.
Next Steps:
GitHub: Continue practicing using branches, issues, and pull requests for more efficient collaboration with my team.
Trello: I plan to investigate how to better structure the Trello board for task tracking and prioritize the tasks based on the project’s deadlines.
Group Coordination: Meet with the team to finalize the project plan, assign specific tasks, and set milestones for the coming weeks.
Reflection:
This week has been about learning the tools we’ll use throughout the project. While the initial setup was challenging, I now feel more comfortable navigating GitHub, Slack, and Trello. I’m looking forward to collaborating more effectively with my team as we begin the real work on the project.
