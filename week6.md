Week 6 – Implementing Custom Post Types in WordPress

Overview
This week, I focused on learning how to create custom post types (CPT) in WordPress. Custom post types allow for better content organization and enable more advanced website features by structuring content beyond standard posts and pages.

What I Did
I created a Custom Post Type called "Books" on my WordPress site. The custom post type includes:
A custom functions.php modification to register the "Books" CPT.
A custom post template to display book details.

Custom fields for book information:
Author
Publication year
Genre
A custom archive page to list all books, sorted by year of publication.
After activating the CPT, I added several book entries and tested the archive page to ensure everything was functioning correctly.

What I Learned
Creating a custom post type in WordPress allows developers to tailor content structures to specific needs. By registering a custom post type, I was able to create a new content type that can be displayed separately from standard posts and pages.
I also learned how to use custom taxonomies (such as genres) to better categorize and organize custom post types, making it easier for users to filter and search content.

Reflection
A major takeaway from this week is the power of WordPress flexibility. By leveraging custom post types and taxonomies, WordPress can be turned into a highly flexible CMS that can support a wide range of use cases, from blogs to complex directories or eCommerce sites.

Next Steps
Next week, I plan to:
Learn how to add custom fields to the WordPress backend using Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin.
Explore the creation of custom post type archives and single templates.
Begin integrating custom post types with custom queries to display content on the front-end.
