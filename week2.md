# Week 2 Learning Journal
Content Insights
This week I learned how to use Joomla to make a simple website. I saw how changing the template can make the site look different from the default, and I practiced adding text and images to articles. I also learned how menus connect the pages so visitors can move around the site.
Learning Activities
Logged in to the Joomla admin panel.
Tried changing the site template and colors.
Created new articles with my own words and pictures.
Added menu items to link to each article.
Checked the site to see how it looks after changes.
Career Insights
Building a site in Joomla showed me how content management systems work. These skills are useful if I work in web design or any job where a company needs a website. It also gave me practice in organizing information clearly.
