# Learning Journal – Prac 3: WordPress CMS & Group Interviews

## 1. Introduction
This week’s practical focused on developing a simple WordPress website for my startup project and participating in a group interview activity to prepare for forming project teams. The aim was to gain hands-on experience with the WordPress content management system (CMS) using MAMP for local hosting, and to reflect on collaboration and communication skills through short interview sessions with classmates.

## 2. WordPress CMS Learning
I installed and configured WordPress locally using **MAMP**. The process involved setting up a local server environment, creating a new MySQL database in phpMyAdmin, and completing the WordPress installation.

After successfully logging into the WordPress dashboard, I:
- Installed and activated a new theme (**Astra**) to improve the design.
- Created four main pages: **Home**, **About**, **Services**, and **Contact**.
- Added a **main navigation menu** and set a **static front page** to make the website structured and user-friendly.
- Reused content from my previous Joomla site, which made the process more efficient.

Through this process, I learned how WordPress separates **content** (posts, pages) from **design** (themes) and **functionality** (plugins). Compared to Joomla, I found WordPress to be easier to customize, with a more intuitive interface and a wider range of themes and plugins. This practical exercise strengthened my ability to manage CMS platforms effectively and deepened my understanding of web hosting environments.

## 3. Group Interview Activity
The second part of this practical involved a **round-robin style group interview** to help form teams for the upcoming major project. I met with several classmates, each conversation lasting about one minute, during which we asked each other questions about our **skills, working styles, availability, and expectations** for teamwork.

Some of the questions I asked included:
- What kind of role do you usually take in a team project?
- How much time can you commit each week?
- Do you prefer front-end, back-end, or project management tasks?

From these short interviews, I gathered insights into how different people approach teamwork. It helped me identify classmates who shared similar work ethics and complementary technical skills. I also learned how to communicate clearly and quickly within limited time — an experience that felt similar to a real job interview.

## 4. Insights and Reflection
This week’s activities provided both **technical** and **interpersonal** learning opportunities.

On the technical side, I improved my ability to install and manage WordPress using a local development environment. I now understand better how to configure databases, manage themes, and organize web content effectively.

On the interpersonal side, the group interview taught me the importance of **soft skills** in teamwork — especially communication, reliability, and adaptability. I realized that choosing the right teammates is not just about technical skill but also about shared goals, mutual respect, and responsibility. These insights are directly applicable to future professional and collaborative settings.

## 5. Conclusion
Overall, this practical was very valuable. Setting up WordPress through MAMP enhanced my confidence in web development and CMS management. The group interview exercise gave me meaningful insights into team dynamics and interpersonal communication. Together, these experiences have prepared me for the upcoming group project and for future professional collaboration in real-world environments.
