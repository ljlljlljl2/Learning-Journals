## Learning Activities & Resources

In this week’s practical, I learned how to set up and use **WordPress CMS** locally through **MAMP**. The focus was on understanding the WordPress dashboard, creating pages, setting up menus, and configuring the homepage. I reviewed the differences between **WordPress.org** (self-hosted) and **WordPress.com** (hosted platform), and learned why we must use the WordPress.org version for our assignments.

Through exploring the WordPress interface, I became familiar with:
- **Pages vs. Posts**: Pages are for static content such as About and Contact, while Posts are for blog updates.  
- **Themes**: I installed and activated a theme called **Astra** to improve the layout and design of my site.  
- **Menus**: I created a navigation menu including Home, About, Services, and Contact.  
- **Static Front Page**: Configured a homepage to display static information about SmartLife Service.  

I also read and watched tutorial resources to help with installation and setup:
- [WordPress.org Official Installation Guide](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/)
- [WordPress Essential Training – LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-essential-training-22616273)

## Practical

For my startup project **SmartLife Service**, I created a simple WordPress site locally using **MAMP**.  
The practical steps included:
1. Installing and configuring MAMP as a local development environment.  
2. Creating a database named `startup_wp` in phpMyAdmin.  
3. Installing WordPress and setting up the site using my startup’s name.  
4. Adding the following main pages:
   - **Home:** An introduction to SmartLife Service and its mission.  
   - **About:** Information about the company’s vision and goals.  
   - **Services:** A list of the digital and smart home services offered.  
   - **Contact:** A simple contact section with placeholder details.  
5. Creating and linking all pages through a navigation menu.  
6. Setting a static homepage and customizing the theme.

The website runs locally on my computer and can be accessed via:  
`http://localhost:8888/wordpress/`

## Group Interview Activity

In addition to the website task, I participated in a **group interview session** to help form project teams for the upcoming group project.  
The activity involved one-minute interviews with classmates, where I asked questions to learn more about their working habits, skills, and availability.

Some of the questions I asked included:
- What kind of role do you usually take in a team project?  
- How much time can you commit each week?  
- Do you prefer front-end, back-end, or content management work?  
- How do you handle deadlines and teamwork communication?

Through these short interviews, I learned how important it is to understand team members’ strengths and working styles before forming a group.  
It helped me identify classmates who share similar goals and complementary skills.

## Content Insights

This practical gave me a clearer understanding of how **WordPress CMS** works and how easily it allows users to manage website content without coding everything manually.  
The MAMP setup provided a safe local environment to test configurations before hosting online.  
I now understand how themes, menus, and plugins interact to build a complete website.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

This week’s work improved both my **technical** and **interpersonal** skills.  
Learning to use WordPress made me more confident in managing CMS-based projects, which are common in professional web development.  
The group interview session also helped me develop **communication and teamwork skills**, similar to real-world job interviews.  
I learned that effective collaboration depends not only on technical knowledge but also on shared expectations and accountability.
