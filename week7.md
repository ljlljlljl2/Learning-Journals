This week, I created a small PHP website called “Daily Motivation Portal.”
Through this project, I learned how to combine PHP with HTML to make a dynamic web page.
I practiced several important PHP concepts:
Using echo to output different types of HTML elements dynamically.
Applying if/else statements to make decisions, such as greeting the user differently depending on the time of day.
Using for, while, and foreach loops to repeat actions and display array content.
Writing a function with parameters to display quotes neatly.
Using include to share a common header and footer between multiple pages.
This project helped me understand how PHP can generate reusable and interactive web pages.
I also improved my confidence in structuring small web projects and keeping my code clean and modular.
