# Learning Journal – Local Dynamic Site (Flask + SQLite)

## 🧠 What I Learned
In this practical, I learned how to set up a **local development environment** using **Flask** and **SQLite** in VS Code.  
I now understand how a dynamic website interacts with a database, how routes and templates work in Flask, and how to manage a local Python environment.

## ⚙️ Tools and Environment
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Language:** Python 3.10  
- **Framework:** Flask 3.x  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **Operating System:** macOS

## 💻 Steps to Run
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.  
2. Install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open the site in your browser:  
   👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## 🌐 Site Description
The website allows users to submit text messages via a form.  
These messages are stored in a local SQLite database and displayed dynamically on the page.  

This demonstrates how Flask handles both frontend rendering (HTML template) and backend logic (Python routes + database).

## 📸 Evidence (Screenshots)
- Screenshot 1: Browser showing the local site and URL  
- Screenshot 2: VS Code terminal showing Flask running  

## 🔗 Reflection
Through this exercise, I gained hands-on experience with backend frameworks and learned how to run a dynamic site locally before deploying to production.  
It helped me better understand the relationship between frontend, backend, and databases.

## ✅ Next Steps
- Try adding Bootstrap for better styling  
- Connect to a cloud database (e.g., Railway or Render)  
- Deploy the site to a live server
