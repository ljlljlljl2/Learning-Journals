# Learning Journal -- Week 2 (Joomla CMS)

## Content Insights

During this week, I gained an understanding of how to use Joomla as a
content management system. I learned how to customize the default
template so that the site looks different and more suitable for my
startup idea. I also learned how to create articles, insert text and
images, and organize them into menus so that the website is easy to
navigate.

## Learning Activities

-   Logged in to the Joomla administration panel.\
-   Explored and changed template settings, including colors, fonts, and
    layout.\
-   Created several articles with relevant text and images.\
-   Set up menu items to connect the articles and improve navigation.\
-   Reviewed the website layout to confirm that changes were applied
    successfully.

## Career Insights

Working with Joomla helped me understand how CMS platforms can be used
to build websites quickly without coding everything from scratch. These
skills are useful in future career paths such as web development,
digital marketing, or managing online business content. It also showed
me the importance of organizing content and design in a professional
way.
