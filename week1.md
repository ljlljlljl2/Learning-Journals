# Week 1

## Learning Activities & Resources
- Read GitHub Pages documentation to understand how to host a static website from a repository.  
- Followed Bootstrap docs to build a simple homepage with navigation, hero section, and responsive layout.  
- Viewed some examples of multi-page static sites online to see how “Home / About / Services” pages are linked together.  
- Compared different Markdown styling guides to prepare for writing this learning journal.  

Resources:  
- https://docs.github.com/en/pages  
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/  
- Sample static website code examples  

## Estimated Hours
About **5 hours** spent this week on understanding hosting, writing HTML + Bootstrap, and setting up the repo.

## Content Insights
This week I built the homepage for “My Startup” website. I learned how to create a navigation bar that links to Home, About, and Services pages. The hero section (“Welcome to My Startup” with subheading and mission) clarified for me how to use headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) and Bootstrap styling to make a page look clean. I also noticed that even a small mismatch in file names (like uppercase vs lowercase, or wrong folder) can break link navigation, so I had to check carefully.  

The process of going from local HTML files (index.html etc.) to seeing the site live under `https://ljlljlljl2.github.io/CP3402/` taught me the importance of details: directory structure, correct file names, consistent links.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
By doing this work, I feel more confident with skills that employers often ask for: being able to build simple static websites by myself, host them, and fix issues like broken links. These are basic but essential skills. Also, using version control (GitHub) and publishing a live site helps me show my work to others — portfolios, resumes, etc.  

For learning, I found that doing the work (writing code, uploading, testing) then checking documentation when things break is more effective. It helps me remember better than just reading docs or watching videos first. Next week I’ll try to allocate time sections: maybe first 30 min reading docs, next 1 hour coding, then testing, etc., to structure my learning more.
